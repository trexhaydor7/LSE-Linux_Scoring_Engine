The **Linux Scoring Engine (LSE)** is meant to be a reliable, read-only tool for defensive cybersecurity teams. Given a Linux system image and defined security objectives, LSE will audit all
vulnerabilites and award points once completed. LSE's mission is to provide the necesssary framework for educating cybersecurity students and professionals alike. BY emphasizing transparency, reproductibility 
and strong industry practice, LSE teaches not only what is *vulernable*, but why it *matters*.

Future features include encryption of _all vulernabilities_, expanding the types of vulenerabilites tested, and gradual support for **future operating systems** beyond Linux.
